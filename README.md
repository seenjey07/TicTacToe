### In this JavaScript project, I've developed an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game that brings the classic 2-player challenge to life. Users not only engage in strategic battles but also have the freedom to choose their preferred player character, adding a personalized touch to the gaming experience. Implemented with a combination of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, the game not only ensures smooth functionality but also provides players the convenience to restart the game or undo their moves, offering a dynamic and enjoyable gaming interface.
